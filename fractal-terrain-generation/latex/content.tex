\section*{Introduction}
Stochastic algorithms for the  generation of fractal terrains has a considerable interest in computer graphics, because of their ability to mimic the behaviour of natural terrain.
The applications of fractal terrains is not limited to the generation of  terrain, but includes the generation of clouds, textures, noise and image filters.
In this project we provide and compare three different algorithms that generates fractal landscapes on distributed-memory parallel environments using MPI.

The first, {\em Diamond-Square}, is a simple and widely used recursive algorithm designed to compute high resolution height maps given a low resolution one.
Then we introduce a little-known algorithm that we call {\em Linear Displacement}, that is an attempt to avoid the recursiveness of Diamond-Square.
Finally we discuss an algorithm that uses the {\em Fast Fourier Transform} to do the transform of pink noise, that has an amplitude of $1/f^\alpha$.

\section{Conclusion}
In this work we provided the implementation and discussed three different stochastic algorithms for the generation of fractal landscapes in parallel environments.

The classic Diamond-Square algorithm has the lowest complexity and performed the fastest, although does not scale as nicely in distributed-memory parallel environments due to the fact that there is an increasing amount of communication required between processes. 
The somewhat unusual Linear Displacement algorithm was presented for academic interest, but performs quite poorly both at large scales and in large parallel systems.
Finally, using the Fast Fourier Transform of pink noise we provided an algorithm that is slower than Diamond-Square but behaves more efficiently in large-scale environments, where the data has to be distributed along different memory locations and the number of processes is considerable.

More advanced terrain generations take in account that the fractal properties are not uniform everywhere. A more advanced technique uses {\em multifractal systems} where we combines different fractal algorithms. As a simple experiment we combined the results from the  algorithms we implemented, as can be seen in fig.~\ref{fig:full} \begin{figure}[htb].
